# Correlation Between Economic Data and Financial Market

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between various economic indicators and the financial market. The goal is to analyze how changes in economic data impact stock prices and market trends using Python. The project includes data collection, preprocessing, and visualization to identify patterns, as well as predictive modeling to understand the correlation between these factors.

## Introduction
Financial markets are influenced by various economic indicators such as inflation rates, GDP growth, unemployment rates, interest rates, and consumer sentiment. By analyzing historical economic data alongside stock prices, we aim to uncover patterns that may help predict market movements. This project is implemented in Python, leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
- Collect and preprocess economic and financial market data.
- Visualize correlations between economic indicators and stock prices.
- Build machine learning models to identify potential relationships and predict market trends.
- Develop an interactive analysis pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The project uses multiple datasets, including:
- **Financial Market Data**: Stock prices and index values.
- **Economic Indicators**: Data on GDP, inflation, interest rates, unemployment, etc.

**Note**: Please download the datasets from the specified sources or use the provided scripts to fetch the data.
